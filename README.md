# Climate Analysis and Data Exploration

I need a vacation! How about a trip to Hawaii to fulSfill the need. But first, let's make sure the weather will be just right for the dates I plan on being there.

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do some climate analysis and data exploration on Hawaii's climate database. 

## Precipitation Analysis

Selecting only the `data` and `prcp` values, I designed a query to retriece the last 12 months of precipitation data and then ploted the results.
